### Classification
* It's an object creational pattern
* Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

### Motivation
* Some classes should have only one instance ever created
* For example, your computermay have access to many printers, but there should be only one print queue
* Program should take in mouse movement, but only from one mouse
* Messages should arrive from many sources, but arrive to one client 

### Applicability
* Use the Singleton pattern when there must by exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible from a well-known point.
