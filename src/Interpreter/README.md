### Intent
* Interpre grammar like regex

### Motivation
* Condiser a config file. It has newlines(\n), keys and values
* The grammar for this would look like something like language, configline, key, value
* In reading files - binary files, text files ; you will have to have a concrete method to parse them
* In the config file example in the last slide, you always have key = value

### Applicablity
* Whenyou ahve a simple language to interpret using a grammar
* When efficiency is not a concern
